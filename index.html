    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Feni District (Bengali: à¦«à§‡à¦¨à§€ à¦œà§‡à¦²à¦¾) is a coastal district situated in the south-east of Bangladesh, within Chittagong Division. One of Bangladesh's smallest districts, it is strategically located along the Dhakaâ€“Chittagong transportation corridor. Bordered by India to the north and the Bay of Bengal to the south, it serves as the sole entry point linking Chittagong, the country's primary port city, to the northern districts.

The district's population stood at 1.6 million in 2022, ranking 42nd among 64 districts and 4th least populous in Chittagong Division. Established as Bangladesh's 61st district in 1984 with its administrative hub in Feni city, it was previously a sub-division under Noakhali District. The district comprises six upazilas (sub-districts): Sonagazi, Fulgazi, Parshuram, Daganbhuiyan, Chhagalnaiya and Feni Sadar.

Deriving its name from the Feni River, the district has a rich history spanning five millennia, having been historically part of the greater regions of Noakhali, Comilla, and Tripura. It was ruled by ancient kingdoms before coming under the Muslim rule of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, and later the Mughals from the 17th century, when it briefly served as a frontier settlement with thriving cities. The British gained control in the late 18th century, formally establishing Feni as a sub-division in 1876. Significant infrastructure development, including schools, colleges, roads and railways, occurred in the early 20th century. Feni's students played a vital role during Bangladesh's language movement in the mid-20th century and subsequent independence war, ultimately gaining independence from Pakistan on 6 December 1971.</p>
